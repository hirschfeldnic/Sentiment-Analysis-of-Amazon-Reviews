But most importantly why was the texture of the candy different than the ones I bought from local store? Both claim to be Haribro Gold-Bears Gummy Candy? Is it because the ones from amazon have been sitting in storage for a longer time but the expiration date says 11/2016 so it should be ok, right? The Walgreens haribo bag has expiration of 3/2017. I compared the texture and  the taste of both. Walgreens was stickier, whereby this one bought from Amazon is not sticky but it is lots firmer to the touch and a great work out fir the jaws as difficult to chew, Walgreens was softer. Taste-wise they all taste artificially fruity to me.Packaging wise, the walgreens bag was nicer, has a thicker plastic bag that is reusable because it has a zip lock feature for its 28.8 oz bag. The Amazon 5lb version has a thinner plastic bag so I am wondering if that might be reason that led to the texture difference? But I opened and tested on same day, it is definitely not the same! I tried to trick the kiddo by packaging the Amazon purchased gummies in the Walgreens packaging to see if he will eat them. He noticed the difference immediately.One other thing noted was the Amazon 5lb version was made in Turkey vs the Walgreens was made in Germany.

I battled with this thought, but the mere possibility of dreams coming true was overwhelming! I placed my order. I waited. Very, very impatiently.The day was here. The day that Amazon said my package would be arriving. It was a Saturday and I could think of nothing else. Finally, at 4:42, I saw the UPS truck nearing my home. Four houses away, three, two..I wanted to run towards it, but I knew that wouldn't get them to me faster. I waited more. The suspense eating away at the entirety of my being. The UPS man stepped out of the truck holding a box. I opened the door and shouted hello. He must've thought I was a young child trapped inside a man's body waiting for a new toy. I grabbed the box, ran inside, and tore it open. There it was. Beautiful. Sitting in my arms. I ran to the kitchen and found some scissors, then immediately slashed open the bag.

We came to the conclusion that most of the reviews were outdated and exaggerated. Surely Haribo would have tweaked the formulation. Right??Nope, wrong. We were so wrong. The fateful day arrived, and a massive 5lb bag of glistening, innocuous looking, colorful little gummy bears was delivered. We decided that we would give them a try after lunch. Big mistake.

(But not so soft that they are sticky and stick to your teeth)!  I've loved these since I was young and now my son loves them too. They come in about six different flavors and each one is yummy!  You also get a good mix of colors and flavors. They're a great snack and most people can eat them because they're not a \"chocolate-type candy\" where you'd have to worry about allergies.They arrived at my home fresh and delicious.  To keep them this way, I put them in two \"Freezer Bags\" and of course, I kept some out.  Everyone that's stopped by has had the temptation to eat some and that's OK.  I bought this HUGE five pound bag!Speaking of the Five Pound Bag, the price for this is a true VALUE! These cost so much at the market or candy store at the mall per pound!  And these are the same exact bears, but you don't have to worry if everyone has touched them or how long they've been out in the open before you came along to scoop them up in your bag!

I swear. Hear me out, okay?3 months ago, I had the craving for something sweet, yet something chewy. I went on my Amazon Prime account, and looked up the delicious gummy treat sold by Haribo. I remember eating them whenever I was younger. As I was scrolling, looking at the different types of gummy delicacies, I noticed one that stuck out. It was a 5-pound bag filled to the top with hundreds of these tiny, squishy bears. Immediately, I knew that I found what I had wanted. I figured one bag would last quite a while, seeing as I figured I would only partake in one handful every other day or so.That bag lasted me 3 days.Since then, I have consumed over 20 pounds of gummy bears. My friends have stopped talking to me, my wife left to go live with her mother, and my children cry every time they come in to see me. I see nothing wrong. Well, besides the fact that I don't have electricity anymore and I secretly charge my phone in the hallway outlet of my apartment, since this... hobby is a little expensive since I bought so many bags recently. But, I can stop whenever I want to. So what if I eat a lot of these? They are delicious. I promise I can stop, I just don't want to. I replaced every breakfast, lunch, and dinner with Gummy Bears. I plan to make a huge Memorial Day feast out of nothing more than these tiny bears. If you do get these, prepare to live your life by the bear. Everything you do, you do it for the bear.

The only discomfort I experienced was after bingeing on probably a pound or so shortly after getting them, but it was nothing along the lines of the aforementioned crippling diarrhea associated with the sugar-free bears.Pros:Great value. Although Amazon frequently marks these down to ~$10, even at $20 these are still a great value per ounce.Taste. I am an avid candy connoisseur, and I can assure you that the bears from Turkey taste just as good and have the same famous Haribo texture as the ones from Spain and Germany.Shelf-life. Now, personally I didn't take any measure to preserve them, and I doubt you'd ever need to as you're liable to eat them all long before they start to go stale. But as others have mentioned, and as I will concur, if you do intend to keep them for an extended period of time, storing them in a container, as long as its cool and dry, should definitely keep them from getting that strange waxy texture.Cons:Shipping. The bag arrives in a typical cardboard box. A few have mentioned that their bag was torn, and some went as far as to mention that it appeared that someone had taped the bag. When I received mine, it did indeed have a tiny tear on the bag, but the materiel of the bag is of the type that is prone to that of being easily cut.Also, one consideration to take when ordering is temperature. My personal advice is to order these when the forecast is in cooler temperatures, as I did with mine. I ordered mine on a cloudy week in which the average temperature was in the 60's and my bears were nice and fresh and not stuck together or melted.As summer is rapidly approaching, I would advise you not to order them when the temperature is expected to be in the 80's or above, as your bears will likely arrive as a solid congealed block, unless for some reason that's preferable to you in which case feel free.Overall, these bears are a great value, they taste great, and as long as you're conscious of the temperature when ordering them, I'm sure you'll enjoy them as much as I did.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/711J49iHfYL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71wQUIkRySL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/513MTOrYW7L._SY88.jpg",null,null,null,null,null,"4 people found this helpful","Harib-omg these are delicious!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R31AU74O2UYETF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EVOSE4","Reviewed in the United States  on April 20, 2015","Flavor Name: Goldbears","0.192589275"],["true","1336","B000EVOSE4","4","2","My delivery came very fast.

The flavor of the previous three (3) orders of Haribo gummy bears (Made in Germany, Made in Turkey) was identical or almost identical to the original ones I had in Germany. The size of the gummy bears from all my four (4) orders was smaller than the original ones in Germany.Now, this fourth (4th) order of Haribo gummy bears (from Brazil this time) is a different \"beast\"... Unfortunately, the flavor of these Haribo gummy bears is totally different from the ones of my previous three (3) orders and the original Haribo gummy bears in Germany!  Normally each Haribo gummy bear is supposed to have its individual flavor (i.e. red: a raspberry-like flavor, orange: orange-like flavor, green: strawberry-like flavor, yellow: citrus-like flavor, white: pineapple-like flavor), but the flavor of the gummy bears from this order is all the same! Boring, boring, boring, and so un-original!!! I am very disappointed in Haribo!!! Next time I shall inquire the country of manufacture first before ordering!Oh, and the color of these Haribo gummy bears is different from the original ones! The original ones have a clear and darker color texture than these from Brazil, which have a cloudy and dull color texture.Summary of differences:Original Haribo gummy bears (Germany, Turkey):1. Distinct flavor of each different color2. Clear and darker color texture3. Larger in sizeHaribo gummy bears Made in Brazil:1. No distinct flavor, they taste all the same!2. Cloudy and dull color texture!3. Smaller in size!Thus, anyone, who values and likes the true original Haribo gummy bears, should stick with European-made Haribo gummy bears (Germany and Turkey are fine), and should avoid the ones made in Brazil!!!Sincerely,Marc","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51IHEPh2prL._SY88.jpg",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"1,233 people found this helpful","Inquire the country of manufacture first before ordering!

If you want softer bears, you may not like these though. Mine were fresh, you can tell when they are not.. the outsides start to get harder/dryer and perhaps a bit white looking. This brand gets rid of that gelatin flavor that tends to be more prevalent in the cheaper store bought stuff.For the ones here, made in Turkey, that you will be ordering...Not super-sweet, really the perfect amount of sweetness. Good flavor profiles. Compared to the bears made in Germany, they almost have a subtle vanilla flavor to all of them, and the flavors themselves are not as potent. Honestly I love them both, but I suggest trying them both. You won't notice the vanilla hint without something to compare by, similar to having 2 monitors next to each other to calibrate the other.Now the goldbaren, which can be found online as well...  Their consistency, or level of chewiness, mouthfeel, is almost identical. The german bears use glucose syrup instead of fructose syrup, and have an extra flavor.. the green is actually apple. The apple flavor has grown on me since I've used up the bags I've ordered. My prefernce now leans towards the german goldbaren versus the ones made in Turkey sold here. The flavors are stronger, more in your face, and fruity.

There's no end to them! I tried and failed to eat them all in one sitting. I wanted to experience some of those vaunted side effects that other users have claimed from eating this product. Alas, I probably ate 8 cups worth but still didn't have any real problems.Maybe Haribo has changed their secret formula. I was hoping to have it come out of both ends like some terrible horror story but they stayed put. I did check this morning just in case that they were like corn but I couldn't see any bear pieces in my feces. I guess they got all digested and whatnot. That was kind of disappointing. I totally would have included a picture.Pros:They are flavorful.They didn't give me diarrhea.They are colorful.The price point makes them totally worth it.It's impossible to eat them all in one sitting...I tried!Cons:They didn't give me diarrhea.

My stomach started rolling and complaint and grumbling and tightening and cramping.  I ran for the bathroom.  For HOURS I could not leave the bathroom for more than 5 mins at a time.  I have a splint on my wrist and I was sweating so profusely that even it was soaked in sweat.  The waves of cramping might be close to childbirth contractions.  I was also blacking out and was pretty sure I had a major fever as the sweat continued.  Everytime I hurried to the bathroom, I took my mobile phone in case I needed to call for help.  I was scared and I was also extremely mad because their Sugarless ones were supposed to cause this hell, not these regular ones.  The gas that I had was like nothing I have experienced before.  It was violent, explosive,  and unbelievably loud, not to mention painful.  The diarrhea just kept coming with cramps and noises that only a very tormented body could create.  This went on for HOURS.  Every time I tried to rest, I was just snuggling down in the bed when my body would scream for me to run to the bathroom again.  Tonight, it is more than 24 hours since I ate those evil bears, I've had 2 pieces of toast, one bottle of water, and my stomach and intestines are still rumbling, complaining, and sore.  Let's not forget the raw soreness of my bottom from a day's worth of violent diarrhea and gas.  Those bears are going in the trash, and I'd really like to know why I suffered the same hell as those who had the Sugarless Haribo Bears!?!

However, what I soon realized is that Haribo had removed the original product that I had heard so much about. I was very disappointed when after eating my fill of these decent tasting gummy snacks I had no such volcanic bowel tremors.  Needless to say, I wanted answers! I did some research and found out where the snacks were manufactured. I traveled to the headquarters in Germany but found that none of their personnel could answer questions. All I heard was that \"you'll need to talk to the recipe owners\" and all but had the door shut in my face. I was about to give up hope and head home when a factory worker waved me over to behind an alley dumpster. She said she couldn't say much, but she put a small slip of paper in my hand and went back to work. After getting to my hotel room, I unfolded a scribbled note with GPS coordinates that I would find out was somewhere in Asia and one word \"Cīnī pitājī\".  After a long journey I found myself in a hole in the wall bar in the back streets of Nepal wondering why I was there. I was pouring myself over the scribbled note and looking at maps of the city trying to figure out where the “recipe owner’s” office might be. I was half way through my Dal bhat when I noticed an old man staring at me while pulling his long white beard. I tried my best Nepali for “can I help you” but he responded in broken English saying, “Cīnī pitājī” under his breath and then stood up and walked out. I frantically threw some rupee on the counter for my meal and ran into the busy street after him.  After following him to the edge of the city, he stopped and pointed to a trail head that lead into a dense forest. I was trying to read the name of the trail on a sign and turned to ask him what it said, but he had vanished as like a ghost. I had a shiver run up my spine, but collected myself and marched on anyways. It was still early in the day so I figured I could find something at the end of this trail by day break. I was wrong. I hiked that entire day and half way into the next before reaching the foot of a mountain.  What met me at the end of this trail was a set of precarious stair leading up into the mountain range. At the foot was a stone monkey that looked like it was in horrific pain. I once again had to swallow my fear and began climbing. It took me until the mid-afternoon to reach the top and I was dead tired. But what I saw made me forget all my trouble. There was an entire community of what seemed to be monks going from place to place doing daily chores. I stopped the nearest one and showed him the scribbled note. He simply pointed to a window in a tower reaching above the rest of the settlement. I wasn’t going to stop then, so I kept walking. Through the town I went, passing emotionless faces of the residents there. Reaching the building that the tower protruded from I walked right in. No reception of any kind, I kept walking in. But as I walked further in and up, I passed many small rooms with people lying on cots and moaning in pain, and the further I walked the more I was overwhelmed by the horrible smell of death. I figured this must be the sick ward of a sort of hospital.  I finally reached the uppermost room with the window I had seen before. In it was a very old man sitting cross legged and reading a scroll to a small boy that was taking notes at his side. I knelt before him and showed him the note. He immediately said something to the boy and had him leave the room. He then stared me I the eye for what seemed like an eternity before speaking. He said, in surprisingly clear English, “You seek answers, and you have come a long way”. I nodded. “I wish to know why the recipe has changed. Why has the effect gone away?” I replied. He smiled, “My friend, the recipe has changed, but the effect is not gone.” I looked at him with great confusion. I was beginning to get angry, when the boy returned with two grown monks carrying a stretcher. The old man then leaned forward to say “It only has a delayed fuse” and he broke out into diabolical laughter.  It all came to me like an awesome wave. All the people I passed in those rooms weren’t hospital patients. They were traveler just like me, who were seeking the answer. The recipe was new, but the only change was that it now took several months to take effect. My stomach began to make horrible gurgling noises that very minute. Within minutes I had passed out from the pain. I awoke two days later in a Nepalese hospital. The doctors told me they had to throw out the pants I was wearing, and it was several days before I could walk again.  I’m writing this to you all now as I’ve made it back to an internet café.

There are many ingredients:  Corn Syrup, Sugar, Gelatin, Dextrose, Citric Acid, Starch, Artificial and Natural Flavors, Fractionated Coconut Oil, Caarnauba Wax, Beeswax Coating, and Artificial Colors -- Yellow 4, Red 40, and Blue 1.I'm not sure how they cram all those ingredients into a gummi less than an inch tall and a 1/4 wide...but they do...and it tastes amazing.Even now, as I write this review, I'm enjoying a pair of gummis.  My mouth is doing a dance as I type.You won't be disappointed.",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"34 people found this helpful","Five glorious pounds of GUMMI!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R38XCOHYAB811Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EVOSE4","Reviewed in the United States on July 10, 2009","Flavor Name: Goldbears","0.981060661"],["true","693","B000EVOSE4","4","3","These are pretty good gummi bears.

I won a bag of these as a classroom prize.At first, I thought these were going to be ordinary gummy bears, but, boy was I wrong. These candies truly are a step above all other gummy bears. In Germany, this is THE brand of gummy bears. Competitors' bags are sold at much lower prices, but few people buy them - and that's because the difference in quality and taste is noticeable. The other people's reviews regarding sweetness and softness are accurate. Haribo has found the perfect combination.During the rest of my stay in Germany, I became a huge consumer of Haribo candies. Haribo sells other gummy candies, but their \"Gold Bears\" are the best.When I returned to beautiful America, I was disappointed to find that Haribo is not so easy to acquire. They are sold online at other stores at decent prices but after shipping, the cost was quite steep.I am truly excited to see these bears offered on Amazon with free super-saver shipping.If you have never had Haribo Gummi Bears, you really need to try some. A 5-pound bag seems like a large quantity, but I promise, you will not be disappointed.--Edit: Nov 2, 2008 - When I wrote this review two years ago, Haribo was still quite difficult to find at grocery stores. It seems today that I can find them just about anywhere. In this case, Amazon still provides a really great deal on 5 lb bags. If you don't want 5 lbs, you can shop at a local grocery store.But I must recommend this: if you will not eat all of the gummy bears right away, transfer them to an air tight container. If you leave the gummy bears exposed to the air, they will get very stiff after a while.",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"191 people found this helpful","These truly are the best gummi bears in the world!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1FJ372S3GKY0P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EVOSE4","Reviewed in the United States on September 1, 2006","Flavor Name: Goldbears","0.780901041"],["true","1261","B000EVOSE4","3","1","I thought, what a great idea to get gummy bears in bulk... right?

But most importantly why was the texture of the candy different than the ones I bought from local store? Both claim to be Haribro Gold-Bears Gummy Candy? Is it because the ones from amazon have been sitting in storage for a longer time but the expiration date says 11/2016 so it should be ok, right? The Walgreens haribo bag has expiration of 3/2017. I compared the texture and  the taste of both. Walgreens was stickier, whereby this one bought from Amazon is not sticky but it is lots firmer to the touch and a great work out fir the jaws as difficult to chew, Walgreens was softer. Taste-wise they all taste artificially fruity to me.Packaging wise, the walgreens bag was nicer, has a thicker plastic bag that is reusable because it has a zip lock feature for its 28.8 oz bag. The Amazon 5lb version has a thinner plastic bag so I am wondering if that might be reason that led to the texture difference? But I opened and tested on same day, it is definitely not the same! I tried to trick the kiddo by packaging the Amazon purchased gummies in the Walgreens packaging to see if he will eat them. He noticed the difference immediately.One other thing noted was the Amazon 5lb version was made in Turkey vs the Walgreens was made in Germany.

I'll admit that. Haribo Gold-Bears are the one and only type of gummy bear I eat, and I absolutely love ingesting them. Any other kind of gummy bear may be able to trick my eyes, but as soon as they make it to my tongue, they are a mere half-second away from a dry heave and journey through the air down to the ground. Basically, Gold-Bears are the gummies for my soul. When I first saw the option to order a 5lb bag for less than a bag of dog food of equal weight, I quite literally gasped and my insides welled up with happiness. Then suddenly there was a little voice inside my head telling me that it was too good to be true. It must be off-brand. I battled with this thought, but the mere possibility of dreams coming true was overwhelming! I placed my order. I waited. Very, very impatiently.The day was here. The day that Amazon said my package would be arriving. It was a Saturday and I could think of nothing else. Finally, at 4:42, I saw the UPS truck nearing my home. Four houses away, three, two..I wanted to run towards it, but I knew that wouldn't get them to me faster. I waited more. The suspense eating away at the entirety of my being. The UPS man stepped out of the truck holding a box. I opened the door and shouted hello. He must've thought I was a young child trapped inside a man's body waiting for a new toy. I grabbed the box, ran inside, and tore it open. There it was. Beautiful. Sitting in my arms. I ran to the kitchen and found some scissors, then immediately slashed open the bag. I grabbed a handful and raised it to my mouth. Half a second passed...one second...two...by this time my soul had confirmed their true Haribo goodness, and two more handfuls had been thrown in my mouth. I had found it.

We came to the conclusion that most of the reviews were outdated and exaggerated. Surely Haribo would have tweaked the formulation. Right??Nope, wrong. We were so wrong. The fateful day arrived, and a massive 5lb bag of glistening, innocuous looking, colorful little gummy bears was delivered. We decided that we would give them a try after lunch. Big mistake. Without going into too much detail, it was clear that this sugar free treat downright dangerous to eat after a meal.

The onset timing seemed to be variable between the three of us - from about 30 minutes to 3 hours, but rest assured, the end result was the same for all of us. The reviews are real. Very, very real.

It's true. If you've ever tried another brand, you'd know and once you try Haribo, you'd never go back!These Haribo Gummi Candy Gold-Bears are just Bursting with Flavor!  They are soft and chewy. (But not so soft that they are sticky and stick to your teeth)!  I've loved these since I was young and now my son loves them too. They come in about six different flavors and each one is yummy!  You also get a good mix of colors and flavors. They're a great snack and most people can eat them because they're not a \"chocolate-type candy\" where you'd have to worry about allergies.They arrived at my home fresh and delicious.  To keep them this way, I put them in two \"Freezer Bags\" and of course, I kept some out.  Everyone that's stopped by has had the temptation to eat some and that's OK.  I bought this HUGE five pound bag!Speaking of the Five Pound Bag, the price for this is a true VALUE! These cost so much at the market or candy store at the mall per pound!  And these are the same exact bears, but you don't have to worry if everyone has touched them or how long they've been out in the open before you came along to scoop them up in your bag!  That's a big plus for me!I definitely recommend these gummi bears, they are a sweet and delicious treat and the VALUE is phenomenal!  I will definitely be ordering more and different kinds.

I swear. Hear me out, okay?3 months ago, I had the craving for something sweet, yet something chewy. I went on my Amazon Prime account, and looked up the delicious gummy treat sold by Haribo. I remember eating them whenever I was younger. As I was scrolling, looking at the different types of gummy delicacies, I noticed one that stuck out. It was a 5-pound bag filled to the top with hundreds of these tiny, squishy bears. Immediately, I knew that I found what I had wanted. I figured one bag would last quite a while, seeing as I figured I would only partake in one handful every other day or so.That bag lasted me 3 days.Since then, I have consumed over 20 pounds of gummy bears. My friends have stopped talking to me, my wife left to go live with her mother, and my children cry every time they come in to see me. I see nothing wrong. Well, besides the fact that I don't have electricity anymore and I secretly charge my phone in the hallway outlet of my apartment, since this... hobby is a little expensive since I bought so many bags recently. But, I can stop whenever I want to. So what if I eat a lot of these? They are delicious. I promise I can stop, I just don't want to. I replaced every breakfast, lunch, and dinner with Gummy Bears. I plan to make a huge Memorial Day feast out of nothing more than these tiny bears. If you do get these, prepare to live your life by the bear. Everything you do, you do it for the bear.

The only discomfort I experienced was after bingeing on probably a pound or so shortly after getting them, but it was nothing along the lines of the aforementioned crippling diarrhea associated with the sugar-free bears.Pros:Great value. Although Amazon frequently marks these down to ~$10, even at $20 these are still a great value per ounce.Taste. I am an avid candy connoisseur, and I can assure you that the bears from Turkey taste just as good and have the same famous Haribo texture as the ones from Spain and Germany.Shelf-life. Now, personally I didn't take any measure to preserve them, and I doubt you'd ever need to as you're liable to eat them all long before they start to go stale. But as others have mentioned, and as I will concur, if you do intend to keep them for an extended period of time, storing them in a container, as long as its cool and dry, should definitely keep them from getting that strange waxy texture.Cons:Shipping. The bag arrives in a typical cardboard box. A few have mentioned that their bag was torn, and some went as far as to mention that it appeared that someone had taped the bag. When I received mine, it did indeed have a tiny tear on the bag, but the materiel of the bag is of the type that is prone to that of being easily cut.Also, one consideration to take when ordering is temperature. My personal advice is to order these when the forecast is in cooler temperatures, as I did with mine. I ordered mine on a cloudy week in which the average temperature was in the 60's and my bears were nice and fresh and not stuck together or melted.As summer is rapidly approaching, I would advise you not to order them when the temperature is expected to be in the 80's or above, as your bears will likely arrive as a solid congealed block, unless for some reason that's preferable to you in which case feel free.Overall, these bears are a great value, they taste great, and as long as you're conscious of the temperature when ordering them, I'm sure you'll enjoy them as much as I did.</td><td>https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/711J49iHfYL._SY88.jpg</td><td>https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71wQUIkRySL._SY88.jpg</td><td>https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/513MTOrYW7L._SY88.jpg</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>4 people found this helpful</td><td>Harib-omg these are delicious!</td><td>https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R31AU74O2UYETF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EVOSE4</td><td>Reviewed in the United States  on April 20, 2015</td><td>Flavor Name: Goldbears</td><td>0.192589275</td></tr><tr><td>true</td><td>1336</td><td>B000EVOSE4</td><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>My delivery came very fast.

He will go outside, do his business, only to return back in the house to finish the job behind my recliner.  I get, on average, 2-3 hours a sleep.  I wash his doggie bed at least twice a day. I no longer own a pair of house shoes.So to reward myself for all the hard work I’ve put into raising the poop machine from hell.  I noticed Amazon had 5 lbs of gummy goodness for sale.  Gummy bears are my favorite snack.  I always have a baggie full of gummy bears in my purse. So when the UPS man delivered my package, I was so excited to rip the box open and gaze at the most glorious colors of little gummy bears I have ever seen.I have spent a 1 ½ hours meticulously separating the colors.  I then layered them in my clear container by color and by taste.  I have the red bears on the bottom; green bears next, clear in the center, orange near the top and yellow first.

They taste better, have better texture, consistency, and are just straight up quality candy. The only downside is how crazy expensive they can be. Thus you have the workaround of buying bulk. This 5 pound bag does not disappoint and is a fantastic value. It comes in a no nonsense non-retail thick plastic bag. I always rip it open and repackage them in smaller quart size ziploc bags to preserve freshness but that might be overkill. The point is, the bag is not resealable. Once its open its open for good.I've bought a bag every two weeks for the past month and a half and I'm about due to re-up again. Disgusting I know but hey I love gummi bears (for now) so what can you do?In another month I'll be so sick of them I won't be able to even look at a gummi bear without gagging and it'll be on to the next thing. About a year ago I had a really bad run with Skittles where I was eating a family size bag a day. After that was Mountain Dew. I peaked at just under 20 liters a week on that one. Then there was Taco Bell's quasadillas. That just got too expensive. After that came Lifesavers Mints, then fresh Strawberries, then Canned Peaches, Gushers Fruit Snacks, Fudgsicles, Neopolitan Ice Cream, Cinnamon Teddy Grahams, Greek Yogurt, Dominos Cinnastix (*shudder* that one was bad) and finally Haribo Gummi Bears. All of which except the gummi bears make me sick to even think about eating.

Not chewy as usual.- Unpleasant odor; certainly not appealing, anyway.- Greasy.- Bland taste. Not a bad taste, but not the excellent, robust taste for which Gold-Bears are known.You'll notice other reviews with similar comments.

They were moist and soft, exactly as they are in the store. To help keep them this way I divided mine into five smaller 1 lb. portions and placed the bags into a old cookie tin to protect them from light, heat and bugs as well as gummy theives.  It has worked out well, when ever I want I can open a portion and eat a hardfull or two then put them back up.I see these as ideal for parties or bulk bin situations because to can divide them into smaller bags of any size and they are just as good from the beginning to the end, if stored properly.</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>4 people found this helpful</td><td>Yummy Gummy</td><td>https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2TPUR3OS2S9ST/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EVOSE4</td><td>Reviewed in the United States  on March 8, 2015</td><td>Flavor Name: Goldbears</td><td>0.539154195</td></tr><tr><td>true</td><td>388</td><td>B000EVOSE4</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>Anything this good... should be illegal!

Its like they said to  me, \"We will send you 5-Lbs of this delicious candy for your $10, and then we will also send you a check for about $40 that you can keep as a Bonus.  Folks hat whats i boils down to. And the CANDY is good, too... Fresh, Tasty, Chewy, etc.  Give it a try if you want to SAVE MONEY and have a good snack to chew on.  NOTE:  Warning as it may cause your bowels to stop up if you eat too many at one time.  I would NOT recommend eating a full 5-LBS in one day (or even two or three) .... that is a lot of \"Gummy-Stuff\" to work thru your God-given digestive system.

I was hoping to find a sugarless gummi that hopefully would not attack your insides as they are known to do so I guess they succeed in that but that's because they aren't sugarless at all. Now I have a five pound bag of sugar.</td><td>https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/614casJ4tfL._SY88.jpg</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>6 people found this helpful</td><td>Not sugarless!

It took me about a month to finish off all of these and they were as fresh as the day I got them because I kept them sealed.

The flavor of the previous three (3) orders of Haribo gummy bears (Made in Germany, Made in Turkey) was identical or almost identical to the original ones I had in Germany. The size of the gummy bears from all my four (4) orders was smaller than the original ones in Germany.Now, this fourth (4th) order of Haribo gummy bears (from Brazil this time) is a different \"beast\"... Unfortunately, the flavor of these Haribo gummy bears is totally different from the ones of my previous three (3) orders and the original Haribo gummy bears in Germany!  Normally each Haribo gummy bear is supposed to have its individual flavor (i.e. red: a raspberry-like flavor, orange: orange-like flavor, green: strawberry-like flavor, yellow: citrus-like flavor, white: pineapple-like flavor), but the flavor of the gummy bears from this order is all the same! Boring, boring, boring, and so un-original!!! I am very disappointed in Haribo!!! Next time I shall inquire the country of manufacture first before ordering!Oh, and the color of these Haribo gummy bears is different from the original ones! The original ones have a clear and darker color texture than these from Brazil, which have a cloudy and dull color texture.Summary of differences:Original Haribo gummy bears (Germany, Turkey):1. Distinct flavor of each different color2. Clear and darker color texture3. Larger in sizeHaribo gummy bears Made in Brazil:1. No distinct flavor, they taste all the same!2. Cloudy and dull color texture!3. Smaller in size!Thus, anyone, who values and likes the true original Haribo gummy bears, should stick with European-made Haribo gummy bears (Germany and Turkey are fine), and should avoid the ones made in Brazil!!!Sincerely,Marc</td><td>https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51IHEPh2prL._SY88.jpg</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>1,233 people found this helpful</td><td>Inquire the country of manufacture first before ordering!

Better flavors, actual unique flavors with each color versus just having different colors that taste all the same, and they are supposed to be hard. That's why I like them. If you want softer bears, you may not like these though. Mine were fresh, you can tell when they are not.. the outsides start to get harder/dryer and perhaps a bit white looking. This brand gets rid of that gelatin flavor that tends to be more prevalent in the cheaper store bought stuff.For the ones here, made in Turkey, that you will be ordering...Not super-sweet, really the perfect amount of sweetness. Good flavor profiles. Compared to the bears made in Germany, they almost have a subtle vanilla flavor to all of them, and the flavors themselves are not as potent. Honestly I love them both, but I suggest trying them both. You won't notice the vanilla hint without something to compare by, similar to having 2 monitors next to each other to calibrate the other.Now the goldbaren, which can be found online as well...  Their consistency, or level of chewiness, mouthfeel, is almost identical. The german bears use glucose syrup instead of fructose syrup, and have an extra flavor.. the green is actually apple. The apple flavor has grown on me since I've used up the bags I've ordered. My prefernce now leans towards the german goldbaren versus the ones made in Turkey sold here. The flavors are stronger, more in your face, and fruity. The Turkish ones are blander, with a pleasing almost vanilla taste to them that I do enjoy.Bottom line, try both, they are both quite good, but distinctly different as well.

These are the second best as there is another kind I really like that I got in Finland last time I was there. They are definitely the best budget bears out there by far!!This 5lb bag doesn't look all that big but once you open it and dig in, it seems like those little bears are going to last forever. There's no end to them! I tried and failed to eat them all in one sitting. I wanted to experience some of those vaunted side effects that other users have claimed from eating this product. Alas, I probably ate 8 cups worth but still didn't have any real problems.Maybe Haribo has changed their secret formula. I was hoping to have it come out of both ends like some terrible horror story but they stayed put. I did check this morning just in case that they were like corn but I couldn't see any bear pieces in my feces. I guess they got all digested and whatnot. That was kind of disappointing. I totally would have included a picture.Pros:They are flavorful.They didn't give me diarrhea.They are colorful.The price point makes them totally worth it.It's impossible to eat them all in one sitting...I tried!Cons:They didn't give me diarrhea. I was really hoping to have a fun story to tell.-----If you found this review helpful in any way, please click the 'Yes' button below.

Not these regular ones.  They lied.  I ate some of these last night, probably more than I should.  Nothing happened.  Until this morning. My stomach started rolling and complaint and grumbling and tightening and cramping.  I ran for the bathroom.  For HOURS I could not leave the bathroom for more than 5 mins at a time.  I have a splint on my wrist and I was sweating so profusely that even it was soaked in sweat.  The waves of cramping might be close to childbirth contractions.  I was also blacking out and was pretty sure I had a major fever as the sweat continued.  Everytime I hurried to the bathroom, I took my mobile phone in case I needed to call for help.  I was scared and I was also extremely mad because their Sugarless ones were supposed to cause this hell, not these regular ones.  The gas that I had was like nothing I have experienced before.  It was violent, explosive,  and unbelievably loud, not to mention painful.  The diarrhea just kept coming with cramps and noises that only a very tormented body could create.  This went on for HOURS.  Every time I tried to rest, I was just snuggling down in the bed when my body would scream for me to run to the bathroom again.  Tonight, it is more than 24 hours since I ate those evil bears, I've had 2 pieces of toast, one bottle of water, and my stomach and intestines are still rumbling, complaining, and sore.  Let's not forget the raw soreness of my bottom from a day's worth of violent diarrhea and gas.  Those bears are going in the trash, and I'd really like to know why I suffered the same hell as those who had the Sugarless Haribo Bears!?!  I'm still passing lots of gas (GasX helped for a while) and still have some diarrhea (not moving and/or Immodium seemed to help for a bit).  So buyer be warned, these are not Sugarless, according to packaging and this site, but they may has well have for all the pure, scary, painful hell I have been through.  I'm pretty sure that food poisoning may be less traumatic than these frickin bears!  I'm will never buy Haribo anything, ever again.

It came in a clear package with just a small sticker of what was supposed to be inside. They looked like regular gummy bears, BUT all you had to do was try one to know these were not real Haribo Gold Gummy Bears. They tasted like soaped up candy.There is no way at all that these could possibly be from the Haribo company. These have to be some type of scam or knock off.I immediately contacted Amazon about the problem. I can say that a full refund was authorized plus not to return any of the candy.I truly feel there is a 3rd party seller trying to get rid of bad stock through Amazon. If people buy and don’t complain the seller gets the money. But if they do complain then they just refund your money and tell you to keep them.They truly weren’t edible. And just to make sure it wasn’t my taste buds going craxy, I had others try them. Every single person said the same thing. Very bad taste, if not soapy. Plus no way could these be legitimate Haribo Gold Gummy Bears.So don’t buy these fir any reason. I threw away all of them when I was told I would get a refund.

The last few orders were received as a sack of solid goop, with everything completely melted together into a block of gelatin.  The second time there couldn't have been more than an hour or so that it sat outside before we realized the package had arrived, as we were periodically checking for delivery, so the question arises as to whether they may have had extended exposure to the heat at some point prior to showing up at our home.Of course Amazon was quite dependable, as usual, with regard to refund/replacement concerns but I'm thinking there should be a bit more thought involved when food items are concerned.  We live in Phoenix where it gets insanely hot during the summer, so you would think that the creative minds in charge at Amazon would have some sort of protocol in place that would make seasonal adjustment to the typical 'drop it and run' approach when delivering food products.</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>Outdoor Food Delivery In Summer Heat?</td><td>https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RHDHQ759CKBPG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EVOSE4</td><td>Reviewed in the United States on September 1, 2020</td><td>Flavor Name: Goldbears</td><td>0.347832256</td></tr><tr><td>true</td><td>2195</td><td>B000EVOSE4</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>Originally I purchased this product hoping it would be as flavorful as ones I recently ate at a major hotel chain I stayed in NJ...

Moments later he doubled over hitting his head on the desk, knocking himself out as his bowels evacuated through his Dockers.  Shooting a fine spray of what I can only assume is a mix of plasma, hellfire, and skunk musk not I my on the wall but the 3 coworkers next to him.  They each in turn stared in shock as they were coated with a mist of evil. Then the smell hit causing a chain reaction of vomiting eerily similar to the pie contest in Stand By Me.  Soon customers and employees alike were projectile vomiting.

However, what I soon realized is that Haribo had removed the original product that I had heard so much about. I was very disappointed when after eating my fill of these decent tasting gummy snacks I had no such volcanic bowel tremors.  Needless to say, I wanted answers! I did some research and found out where the snacks were manufactured. I traveled to the headquarters in Germany but found that none of their personnel could answer questions. All I heard was that \"you'll need to talk to the recipe owners\" and all but had the door shut in my face. I was about to give up hope and head home when a factory worker waved me over to behind an alley dumpster. She said she couldn't say much, but she put a small slip of paper in my hand and went back to work. After getting to my hotel room, I unfolded a scribbled note with GPS coordinates that I would find out was somewhere in Asia and one word \"Cīnī pitājī\".  After a long journey I found myself in a hole in the wall bar in the back streets of Nepal wondering why I was there. I was pouring myself over the scribbled note and looking at maps of the city trying to figure out where the “recipe owner’s” office might be. I was half way through my Dal bhat when I noticed an old man staring at me while pulling his long white beard. I tried my best Nepali for “can I help you” but he responded in broken English saying, “Cīnī pitājī” under his breath and then stood up and walked out. I frantically threw some rupee on the counter for my meal and ran into the busy street after him.  After following him to the edge of the city, he stopped and pointed to a trail head that lead into a dense forest. I was trying to read the name of the trail on a sign and turned to ask him what it said, but he had vanished as like a ghost. I had a shiver run up my spine, but collected myself and marched on anyways. It was still early in the day so I figured I could find something at the end of this trail by day break. I was wrong. I hiked that entire day and half way into the next before reaching the foot of a mountain.  What met me at the end of this trail was a set of precarious stair leading up into the mountain range. At the foot was a stone monkey that looked like it was in horrific pain. I once again had to swallow my fear and began climbing. It took me until the mid-afternoon to reach the top and I was dead tired. But what I saw made me forget all my trouble. There was an entire community of what seemed to be monks going from place to place doing daily chores. I stopped the nearest one and showed him the scribbled note. He simply pointed to a window in a tower reaching above the rest of the settlement. I wasn’t going to stop then, so I kept walking. Through the town I went, passing emotionless faces of the residents there. Reaching the building that the tower protruded from I walked right in. No reception of any kind, I kept walking in. But as I walked further in and up, I passed many small rooms with people lying on cots and moaning in pain, and the further I walked the more I was overwhelmed by the horrible smell of death. I figured this must be the sick ward of a sort of hospital.  I finally reached the uppermost room with the window I had seen before. In it was a very old man sitting cross legged and reading a scroll to a small boy that was taking notes at his side. I knelt before him and showed him the note. He immediately said something to the boy and had him leave the room. He then stared me I the eye for what seemed like an eternity before speaking. He said, in surprisingly clear English, “You seek answers, and you have come a long way”. I nodded. “I wish to know why the recipe has changed. Why has the effect gone away?” I replied. He smiled, “My friend, the recipe has changed, but the effect is not gone.” I looked at him with great confusion. I was beginning to get angry, when the boy returned with two grown monks carrying a stretcher. The old man then leaned forward to say “It only has a delayed fuse” and he broke out into diabolical laughter.  It all came to me like an awesome wave. All the people I passed in those rooms weren’t hospital patients. They were traveler just like me, who were seeking the answer. The recipe was new, but the only change was that it now took several months to take effect. My stomach began to make horrible gurgling noises that very minute. Within minutes I had passed out from the pain. I awoke two days later in a Nepalese hospital. The doctors told me they had to throw out the pants I was wearing, and it was several days before I could walk again.  I’m writing this to you all now as I’ve made it back to an internet café. But I am a broken man now. And I only want to tell you my story, and send this warning.</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>57 people found this helpful</td><td>The recipe has changed.

It is just too beautiful.  Five glorious pounds of gummi.  It sits on my kitchen table.  The rainbow of colors twinkling in the sunlight.  Every time I get close to picking this HUGE bag up, my heart starts racing.These Gummis were made in Turkey and imported into Baltimore.The bag is not resealable so ensure you have some tupperware or a resealable bag when you open it.  A resealable bag is a must.  Gummis that have been exposed to air will harden and lose flavor.  To waste a single, solitary gummi would be a crime.For those who track such things, the average gummi serving is 17 pieces.  That serving will get you 140 calories.  With FIVE pounds of gummis, you will be counting all night long.It takes, on average, approximately 45 minutes for a gummi to melt away in your mouth -- that is, if you can keep it in your mouth that long.  Most people, myself included, will immediately start chewing on the gummi to get at the tasty fruit flavors.Speaking of flavors, let's talk about the goodness that goes into a gummi.  There are many ingredients:  Corn Syrup, Sugar, Gelatin, Dextrose, Citric Acid, Starch, Artificial and Natural Flavors, Fractionated Coconut Oil, Caarnauba Wax, Beeswax Coating, and Artificial Colors -- Yellow 4, Red 40, and Blue 1.I'm not sure how they cram all those ingredients into a gummi less than an inch tall and a 1/4 wide...but they do...and it tastes amazing.Even now, as I write this review, I'm enjoying a pair of gummis.

I won a bag of these as a classroom prize.At first, I thought these were going to be ordinary gummy bears, but, boy was I wrong. These candies truly are a step above all other gummy bears. In Germany, this is THE brand of gummy bears. Competitors' bags are sold at much lower prices, but few people buy them - and that's because the difference in quality and taste is noticeable. The other people's reviews regarding sweetness and softness are accurate. Haribo has found the perfect combination.During the rest of my stay in Germany, I became a huge consumer of Haribo candies. Haribo sells other gummy candies, but their \"Gold Bears\" are the best.When I returned to beautiful America, I was disappointed to find that Haribo is not so easy to acquire. They are sold online at other stores at decent prices but after shipping, the cost was quite steep.I am truly excited to see these bears offered on Amazon with free super-saver shipping.If you have never had Haribo Gummi Bears, you really need to try some. A 5-pound bag seems like a large quantity, but I promise, you will not be disappointed.--Edit: Nov 2, 2008 - When I wrote this review two years ago, Haribo was still quite difficult to find at grocery stores. It seems today that I can find them just about anywhere. In this case, Amazon still provides a really great deal on 5 lb bags. If you don't want 5 lbs, you can shop at a local grocery store.But I must recommend this: if you will not eat all of the gummy bears right away, transfer them to an air tight container. If you leave the gummy bears exposed to the air, they will get very stiff after a while.</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>191 people found this helpful</td><td>These truly are the best gummi bears in the world!</td><td>https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1FJ372S3GKY0P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EVOSE4</td><td>Reviewed in the United States on September 1, 2006</td><td>Flavor Name: Goldbears</td><td>0.780901041</td></tr><tr><td>true</td><td>1261</td><td>B000EVOSE4</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>I thought, what a great idea to get gummy bears in bulk... right?

They have just the right amount of firmness and sweetness.  My bag arrived very promptly and the bears had not melted or fused in any way.I used to buy the CVS brand of Haribo gummi bears, called \"Gold Bond.\"  Recently, however, they have changed their formula and the bears are now too much different from true Haribo bears.  They are too sweet, have too much of a chemical taste, and they are not firm enough or chewy enough.  So I am glad I found this alternative.

This particular item, however, is NOT the sugar-free version and does not have that problem.These gummi bears are made in Turkey and are not quite the same as the ones made in Germany, but they are of excellent quality.  They have just the right amount of firmness and sweetness.  My bag arrived very promptly and the bears had not melted or fused in any way.I used to buy the CVS brand of Haribo gummi bears, called \"Gold Bond.\"  Recently, however, they have changed their formula and the bears are now too much different from true Haribo bears.  They are too sweet, have too much of a chemical taste, and they are not firm enough or chewy enough.  So I am glad I found this alternative.  I eat them so regularly that this is a much better buy than getting them in those little bags you find in most stores. This is an excellent product.</td><td>List(Ignore, all, reviews, that, describe, gastrointestinal, distress, yet, award, 5, stars, The, combination, of, the, best, possible, rating, with, the, worst, imaginable, description, is, evidence, that, those, reviews, are, fake, What, makes, them, SEEM, real, is, that, the, sugar, free, version, of, this, candy, does, indeed, have, a, laxative, effect, This, particular, item, however, is, NOT, the, sugar, free, version, and, does, not, have, that, problem, These, gummi, bears, are, made, in, Turkey, and, are, not, quite, the, same, as, the, ones, made, in, Germany, but, they, are, of, excellent, quality, They, have, just, the, right, amount, of, firmness, and, sweetness, My, bag, arrived, very, promptly, and, the, bears, had, not, melted, or, fused, in, any, way, I, used, to, buy, the, CVS, brand, of, Haribo, gummi, bears, called, Gold, Bond, Recently, however, they, have, changed, their, formula, and, the, bears, are, now, too, much, different, from, true, Haribo, bears, They, are, too, sweet, have, too, much, of, a, chemical, taste, and, they, are, not, firm, enough, or, chewy, enough, So, I, am, glad, I, found, this, alternative, I, eat, them, so, regularly, that, this, is, a, much, better, buy, than, getting, them, in, those, little, bags, you, find, in, most, stores, This, is, an, excellent, product, )</td><td>List(Ignore, reviews, describe, gastrointestinal, distress, yet, award, 5, stars, combination, best, possible, rating, worst, imaginable, description, evidence, reviews, fake, makes, SEEM, real, sugar, free, version, candy, indeed, laxative, effect, particular, item, however, sugar, free, version, problem, gummi, bears, made, Turkey, quite, ones, made, Germany, excellent, quality, right, amount, firmness, sweetness, bag, arrived, promptly, bears, melted, fused, way, used, buy, CVS, brand, Haribo, gummi, bears, called, Gold, Bond, Recently, however, changed, formula, bears, much, different, true, Haribo, bears, sweet, much, chemical, taste, firm, enough, chewy, enough, glad, found, alternative, eat, regularly, much, better, buy, getting, little, bags, find, stores, excellent, product, )</td><td>ignore reviews describe gastrointestinal distress yet award stars combination best possible rating worst imaginable description evidence reviews fake makes seem real sugar free version candy indeed laxative effect particular item however sugar free version problem gummi bears made turkey quite ones made germany excellent quality right amount firmness sweetness bag arrived promptly bears melted fused way used buy cvs brand haribo gummi bears called gold bond recently however changed formula bears much different true haribo bears sweet much chemical taste firm enough chewy enough glad found alternative eat regularly much better buy getting little bags find stores excellent product</td><td>[ignore, reviews, describe, gastrointestinal, distress, yet, award, stars, combination, best, possible, rating, worst, imaginable, description, evidence, reviews, fake, makes, seem, real, sugar, free, version, candy, indeed, laxative, effect, particular, item, however, sugar, free, version, problem, gummi, bears, made, turkey, quite, ones, made, germany, excellent, quality, right, amount, firmness, sweetness, bag, arrived, promptly, bears, melted, fused, way, used, buy, cos, brand, harbor, gummi, bears, called, gold, bond, recently, however, changed, formula, bears, much, different, true, harbor, bears, sweet, much, chemical, taste, firm, enough, chewy, enough, glad, found, alternative, eat, regularly, much, better, buy, getting, little, bags, find, stores, excellent, product]</td><td>ignore review describe gastrointestinal distress yet award star combination best possible rating worst imaginable description evidence review fake make seem real sugar free version candy indeed laxative effect particular item however sugar free version problem gummi bear made turkey quite one made germany excellent quality right amount firmness sweetness bag arrived promptly bear melted fused way used buy co brand harbor gummi bear called gold bond recently however changed formula bear much different true harbor bear sweet much chemical taste firm enough chewy enough glad found alternative eat regularly much better buy getting little bag find store excellent product</td></tr><tr><td>true</td><td>3150</td><td>B000EVOSE4</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>Was hoping to get the sugar free gummies.

The only discomfort I experienced was after bingeing on probably a pound or so shortly after getting them, but it was nothing along the lines of the aforementioned crippling diarrhea associated with the sugar-free bears.Pros:Great value. Although Amazon frequently marks these down to ~$10, even at $20 these are still a great value per ounce.Taste. I am an avid candy connoisseur, and I can assure you that the bears from Turkey taste just as good and have the same famous Haribo texture as the ones from Spain and Germany.Shelf-life. Now, personally I didn't take any measure to preserve them, and I doubt you'd ever need to as you're liable to eat them all long before they start to go stale. But as others have mentioned, and as I will concur, if you do intend to keep them for an extended period of time, storing them in a container, as long as its cool and dry, should definitely keep them from getting that strange waxy texture.Cons:Shipping. The bag arrives in a typical cardboard box. A few have mentioned that their bag was torn, and some went as far as to mention that it appeared that someone had taped the bag. When I received mine, it did indeed have a tiny tear on the bag, but the materiel of the bag is of the type that is prone to that of being easily cut.Also, one consideration to take when ordering is temperature. My personal advice is to order these when the forecast is in cooler temperatures, as I did with mine. I ordered mine on a cloudy week in which the average temperature was in the 60's and my bears were nice and fresh and not stuck together or melted.As summer is rapidly approaching, I would advise you not to order them when the temperature is expected to be in the 80's or above, as your bears will likely arrive as a solid congealed block, unless for some reason that's preferable to you in which case feel free.Overall, these bears are a great value, they taste great, and as long as you're conscious of the temperature when ordering them, I'm sure you'll enjoy them as much as I did.</td><td>https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/711J49iHfYL._SY88.jpg</td><td>https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71wQUIkRySL._SY88.jpg</td><td>https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/513MTOrYW7L._SY88.jpg</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>4 people found this helpful</td><td>Harib-omg these are delicious!</td><td>https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R31AU74O2UYETF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EVOSE4</td><td>Reviewed in the United States  on April 20, 2015</td><td>Flavor Name: Goldbears</td><td>0.192589275</td><td>First off, let's clarify one thing, if you're looking to cause yourself or others gastrointestinal distress, these are NOT the bears you are looking for.These are sweetened using sugar, not the artificial sweeteners in the sugar-free gummies that are renowned for their colon cleansing powers.As such, you should not have any problems consuming more than the recommended amount without having your insides explode.

My 16 y/o son brings home a puppy, Dually, Feb. 13, 2014.  Since this adorable creature has entered our casa, my life has turned upside down.  Dually, aka Sir Poops-A-Lot, has kept me up at nights howling.  He poops more than anything I’ve ever seen in my life.  He will go outside, do his business, only to return back in the house to finish the job behind my recliner.  I get, on average, 2-3 hours a sleep.  I wash his doggie bed at least twice a day.
